This plugin is free to use and is not actively supported by the author, but will be monitored for serious bugs that may need correcting.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `slidedeck3-lite` folder and all its contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Create a new SlideDeck from the “SlideDeck » Manage” menu in the control panel sidebar
4. Insert a SlideDeck in your post or page by clicking on the "Embed a SlideDeck" button above the rich text editor in the post/page view.

You can also place a SlideDeck in your template or theme via the PHP command “do_shortcode()”. Just pass the ID of the SlideDeck you want to render. For example:
“< ? php echo do_shortcode( "[SlideDeck2 id=1644]" ); ? >“

Where 1644 is the SlideDeck's ID. You can also see this code snippet when you save a new SlideDeck for the first time.

== Screenshots ==

1. The SlideDeck manage view.
2. The editing interface showing the current deck and the top of the lens selection area.
3. One of the many settings page available to you. You can tweak dozens of settings for each SlideDeck.
4. Example - YouTube videos from TEDtalksDirector using the Tool Kit Lens.
5. The source selection popup for dynamic source content.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do you have an affiliate program? =
Yes, we do! It's free to join, and you can get up to a 30% commission on each sale of SlideDeck you refer to us - that's $30 per sale! Go here to sign up: [http://slidedeck.com/affiliates](http://slidedeck.com/affiliates)


= Can I show multiple SlideDecks on one page? =
Of course! The only limitation is the number of slides per SlideDeck, and what kind of content you're sourcing for each slide. The greater the amount of content you're trying to show all at once, the slower your pages will render for your visitors, so avoid trying to show 10 SlideDecks, each with 10 YouTube videos, as it'll make your page pretty sluggish!


= What's with this sharing overlay? Can I disable that? =
Yes!
If you don't want your visitors to easily share your SlideDeck with their social networks, you can disable the sharing overlay in the deck settings. Just set "Show Overlay" to "Never."


= Can I Choose Which WordPress Pages to Show in a SlideDeck? (Featured Posts/Pages) =
If you want to use the WordPress Posts Content Source to add pages to your SlideDeck, but want to include/exclude certain pages then you'll have to add custom taxonomies to your pages. By default WordPress Posts have tags and categories, but Pages do not. The easiest way to mark certain pages on your WordPress site for inclusion in a SlideDeck is to give them categories or tags. A plugin like GD Custom Posts And Taxonomies Tools allows you to add custom taxonomies to your posts and pages. For instance, you could add a category called "Home Page SlideDeck" to your pages and then those pages can be pulled into your SlideDeck.


= What’s the difference between SlideDeck 2 and SlideDeck 3 for WordPress? =
The most important improvement is that SlideDeck 3 is designed to work smoothly across all the devices and screen sizes. With SEO optimized images, Google can read your slider easily. With text animation, sliders can be made more interactive. That's just the tip of the iceberg, though.
